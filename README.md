#Getting and Cleaning Data Project

### Dataset origin

* Data were obtained from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

* According to the readme file included in the zipfile above, this is the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0"

* According to the above document, the dataset is relative to experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### How is the dataset organized

* Data for train and test samples are split in different folders
* In each folder, _x*.txt_ contains all the values from accelerometer and gyroscope, _y*.txt_ contains values for activities (_see Code Book_) and _subject*.txt_ contains informations to attribute each line from x and y to a subject
* A legend for activities (again, _see Code Book_) is in the main folder (_activity_labels.txt_)


### What my script does

My **_run_analysis.R_** does not assume you have downloaded anything.

* It downloads and unzip the file from the url above. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
